## üõ†Ô∏è Installation on VPS

### 1. VPS Preparation

Update system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Install Node.js:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Verify Node.js installation:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

Install FFmpeg:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg -y
```

Verify FFmpeg:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

Install Git:

```bash
sudo apt install git -y
```

### 2. StreamFlow Project Setup

Clone the repository to your VPS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bangtutorial/streamflow
```

Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd streamflow
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Generate session secret:

```bash
npm run generate-secret
```

**Additional configuration (optional):**

The default application port is **7575**. If you need to change the port, edit the .env file (e.g., 8080, 3300, etc.):

```bash
nano .env
```

### 3. Firewall Setup

Open the port according to your .env file (default: 7575):

```bash
sudo ufw allow 7575
```

Enable firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

Check firewall status:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

### 4. Install Process Manager (PM2)

Install PM2:

```bash
sudo npm install -g pm2
```

### 5. How to Run StreamFlow Application

Ensure you are still in the streamflow folder, then run this command:

```bash
pm2 start app.js --name streamflow
```

Access the application at <b>SERVER_IP:PORT</b><br>
Example:

```bash
88.12.34.56:7575
```

Create a username and password. After logging into the Dashboard, Sign Out. Then restart the application with:

```bash
pm2 restart streamflow
```

## üê≥ Running with Docker

You can also run StreamFlow using Docker. This is a convenient way to get the application running without manually installing dependencies.

A pre-built image is also available on Docker Hub, which can be pulled directly.

**Pull from Docker Hub (Recommended):**
```bash
docker pull anasrudin/streamflow:latest
```

**Alternatively, Build the Docker Image Locally:**

First, build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`. Make sure you have Docker installed on your system.

```bash
docker build -t streamflow .
```

**Run the Docker Container:**

Once the image is built or pulled, you can run it as a container.

```bash
docker run -d -p 7575:7575 --name streamflow-app anasrudin/streamflow:latest
```

Explanation of the command:
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 7575:7575`: Maps port 7575 on your host to port 7575 in the container. If you changed the port in the `.env` file, adjust the host port accordingly (e.g., `-p YOUR_HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT`).
- `--name streamflow-app`: Assigns a name to your container for easier management.
- `anasrudin/streamflow:latest`: Specifies the image to use from Docker Hub. If you built it locally, you can use the local image name (e.g., `streamflow`).

**Accessing the Application:**

After the container starts, you can access StreamFlow in your web browser at:

```
http://localhost:7575
```

Or, if you are running it on a VPS:

```
http://YOUR_VPS_IP:7575
```

**4. Managing the Container:**

- To view logs: `docker logs streamflow-app`
- To stop the container: `docker stop streamflow-app`
- To start a stopped container: `docker start streamflow-app`
- To remove the container (after stopping it): `docker rm streamflow-app`

**5. Uploading to Docker Hub:**

A script is provided to help you build and upload your image to Docker Hub.

```bash
./upload_to_dockerhub.sh
```
This script will prompt you for your Docker Hub username and the desired image name. It will then build the image, tag it with the version from `package.json` and as `latest`, and ask if you want to push it to Docker Hub.

## üìù Additional Information

### Reset Password

If you forget your password or want to reset it, follow these steps:

Navigate to the application folder:

```bash
cd streamflow
```

Run the password reset command:

```bash
node reset-password.js
```

### Server Time Setup (Timezone)

To ensure scheduled streaming runs at the correct time, set the server timezone to your local timezone:

#### 1. Check Current Timezone

View active timezone:

```bash
timedatectl status
```

#### 2. View Available Timezones

Search for your timezone (example for Indonesia):

```bash
timedatectl list-timezones | grep Asia
```

Example: Set Timezone to WIB (Jakarta):

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Jakarta
```

Verify changes:

```bash
timedatectl status
```

After changing the timezone, restart the application for the changes to take effect:

```bash
pm2 restart streamflow
```

## ü™õ Troubleshooting

### Permission Error

Fix permissions for the uploads folder:

```bash
chmod -R 755 public/uploads/
```

### Port Already in Use

Check processes using the port:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :7575
```

Kill the process if necessary:

```bash
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

### Database Error

Reset database (CAUTION: this will delete all data):

```bash
rm db/*.db
```

Restart the application to create a new database.
